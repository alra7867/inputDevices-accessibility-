<h2> Inspiration   </h2>
<p> Hi everybody, before talking about any trends in the HCI education related work, I want to talk about something. Hopefully, that can inspire you to work in this field.
There are probably 781 million people in the world that are illeterate, Out of which 496 are the women. We all agree on this thing that, to bring change or betterment in our society. One of the most important thing is to provide quality education
and educational resources. Yet we don't come with concrete or innovative ways that often to help bridge this literacy gap. I personally feel we can together, can bring change to the envirnment around us, even its
working in some library, homeless,and accessibility support center. Change can be in any good form but goodness of education can help us in bringing this change.Thanks for reading this paragraph, lets jump to next one now.
