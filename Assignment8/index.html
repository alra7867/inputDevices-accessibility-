			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>Include information here about your app.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Instructions for using the app</li>
				<p> You can use the navigation keys to move around the application and press P for the selection of that element. Whereas you can also use the W(up), S(down), A(left) , D(right) for navigation with the nose and use P for the selection	</p>
				<li>Test results</li>
				<p> <b>Test protocol: </b> <br>

You have to complete the following five tasks using the calculator but complete with two body parts: (1st with the hands using the arrow keys and P key for pressing, and 2nd with your nose using keys W (for up), A (for left), S (for down), D (for right) and P key for pressing.
<br>
<b>Commands to be performed: </b>
1)	(78*345)-9
<br>
2)	(4278/2)+56 <br>
3)	(35632)-234 <br>
4)	(3490*5) + 345 <br>
5)	(2*2*2)+(3*3) <br>

<br>

<b>Time using the hand:	</b>
It took four minutes for participant to complete the commands using one hand.
<br>
<b>Errors using the hand: </b>
Participant calculated the last command wrong and was not able to get the right answer. Mainly the reason that contributed to this were speed.
<br>

<b>User experience with one hand:</b>

It was easy and straightforward task for me. But using with one hand slowed down my speed since I had to press the P button again and again and that created a mental load on me.
<br>

<b>Time using the nose:</b>

It took almost twenty-three minutes to complete the same set of command using the nose.
<br>
<b>Errors using the nose:</b>

Identifying when the press button is clicked or not was hard
Clicking on wrong navigation buttons repeatedly
The whole process was slow and prone to errors
<br>

<b>User experience:</b>

The process at the start was very frustrating and it took was very slow for the first command but as I progressed through the command, the process became little fast. My neck was hurt badly at the end of this experience and even my eye side became a little blur in the process because after typing each command I had to look at the screen and then at the keyboard again to find the key. An amazing thing, that happened is that I had to create a mental model before executing the commands by thinking how much I am going to press a particular navigation button.
	</p>
	<li><b>Conclusion</b></li>
After completing this process, I got a very sincere and close sense of what people with the disabilities have to go through when using computers or any general gadget. This assignment has provided me immense motivation to design stuff with an element of universal design.
